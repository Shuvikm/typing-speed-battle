# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (Already Done ✅)
```bash
npm install
```

## Step 2: Start the Backend Server

Open **Terminal 1** and run:
```bash
npm run server
```

You should see:
```
🏴‍☠️ Typing Speed Battle Server running on port 3001
Ready for battles! ⚔️
```

## Step 3: Start the Frontend

Open **Terminal 2** and run:
```bash
npm start
```

The React app will open at: **http://localhost:3000**

## 🎮 Or Run Both at Once

If you have `concurrently` installed:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs both the frontend and backend together!

## 🎯 What to Expect

1. **Home Page** - Choose Solo or Battle mode
2. **Room Page** - Enter name, pick avatar, create/join room
3. **Game Page** - Type the text as fast as you can!
4. **Results Page** - See your rank and stats

## 🏴‍☠️ Enjoy Your Typing Battle!
